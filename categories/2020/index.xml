      <description>One of the moments that defined 2020 for me is actually a series of moments. It was part of my remote working experience on Lesbos, Greece. During that stay I worked remote for my employer in The Netherlands, but shared an office with one of the coordinators for Boat Refugee Foundation. She just started with that job, and I saw her pick up the job with an incredible energy. She definitely outperformed expectations, but at the same time she was trying to find her place.</description>
