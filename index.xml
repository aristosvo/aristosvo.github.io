      <description>Last week I was looking for the best solution to connect to Azure services for a few pods within Azure Kubernetes Service. These services are build with Spring Boot and my first idea was to only connect to Azure KeyVault. Along the way I discovered the awesomeness of Managed Service Identities and extended it to another Azure Service, Azure Storage.
Managed Service Identities: a short intro To explain a bit about Managed Service Identities I prefer to point towards the Azure docs:</description>

      <description>One of the subjects I wanted to touch on this blog is my journey in my new job. And with my new job a new cloud adventure started. In my previous job I was primarily focussed on IBM Cloud, AWS and a bit of Google Cloud. Although all clouds are in some way the same, there are also a lot of difficulties, hick-ups and new ideas marching around the corner.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about writing my thoughts down a lot over the years, it never really happened. And although it is now happening, I&amp;rsquo;m still looking which direction to take. My first blog posts will probably focus on my journey, discoveries, tips and tricks from my job experiences and a lot of other stuff you&amp;rsquo;re probably not interested in. However, if you are and want me to know that, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate.</description>
