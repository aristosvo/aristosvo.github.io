      <description>Terraform: This issue is filed to add the last essential parts in the Azure TerraForm provider and is currently under review, after the merge I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do an extra edition with TerraForm.

These services are build with Spring Boot and my first idea was to only connect to Azure KeyVault.</description>
